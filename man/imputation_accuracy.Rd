\usage{
imputation_accuracy(truefn, imputefn, nSNPs = NULL, nAnimals = NULL,
  NAval = 9, standardized = TRUE, adaptive = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{truefn}{Filename to true matrix. NB! Max. 255 characters!}

\item{imputefn}{Filename to imputed matrix.}

\item{nSNPs}{Integer, number of snps (i.e. number of columns minus 1).
If \code{NULL} (default), detected from \code{truefn}.}

\item{nAnimals}{Integer, number of rows.
If \code{NULL} (default), detected from \code{truefn}.}

\item{NAval}{Integer, value of missing genotype.}

\item{standardized}{Logical, whether to center and scale genotypes by dataset in \code{true}-matrix.
Currently by subtracting column mean and dividing by column standard deviation.}

\item{adaptive}{Use adaptive method (default) that stores \code{truefn} and compares rows by ID in first column.}
}
\value{
List with following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{means}}{Column means of true matrix.}
  \item{\code{vars}}{Column variances of true matrix.}
  \item{\code{rowcors}}{Row-wise (animal-wise) correlation between true and imputed matrix.}
  \item{\code{matcor}}{Matrix-wise correlation between true and imputed matrix.}
  \item{\code{colcors}}{Column-wise (locus-wise) correlation between true and imputed matrix.}
  \item{\code{rowID}}{Row IDs, corresponding to \code{rowcors}.}
}
}
\description{
Calculation of column-wise, row-wise, and matrix-wise correlations between
matrix in files \code{truefn} and \code{imputefn}.
Assumes first column in both files is an integer ID column and thus excluded from calculations.
Standardization (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation) is done column-wise based
on means and standard deviations of \code{truefn}.
Correlations are only performed on those rows that are found in \emph{both} files,
based on the first column (ID column).
}
\details{
Genotypes equal to \code{NAval} are considered missing (i.e. \code{NA}) and are not included in the calculations.

This method stores the "true" matrix in memory with a low-precision real type,
and rows in the "imputed" matrix are read and matched by ID.
If there are no extra rows in either matrix and order of IDs is the same,
consider setting \code{adaptive=FALSE}, as this has a memory usage of O(m), compared to O(nm) for the adaptive method, where 'm' is the number of SNPs and 'n' the number of animals.
The non-adaptive method is however, and very surprisingly, slightly slower.
