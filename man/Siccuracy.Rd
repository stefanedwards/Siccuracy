\description{
Calculation of imputation accuracies and similar allele stats.
}
\details{
This package was developed for working with SNP files in the format used in \href{http://alphagenes.roslin.ed.ac.uk}{AlphaSuite}. 
The format of these consists of first column with \emph{integer} sample ID (Individual or Animal ID),
and subsequent column counting minor alleles at each loci:

\tabular{lcccccc}{
 1001  \tab    0   \tab   0    \tab 1    \tab  2   \tab  1   \tab   2 \cr
 1002    \tab 0.05   \tab 0.50   \tab 1.50   \tab 1.80   \tab 0.95     \tab 9 \cr
}

In this example, the file consists of two individuals (\code{1001} and \code{1002}); 
first individual has genotypes (\code{0}, \code{0}, \code{1}, \code{2}, \code{1}, \code{2}) for six loci. 
The second individual has been imputed, and the genotypes are given as real values of best guess. 
The last genotype was not sufficiently imputed and therefore set as missing with value \code{9}.

Requirements for format: Space or tab separated; number of digits is unimportant.

\section{Output format}{


Functions that write new files may have a pair of arguments (\code{int} and \code{format}) 
that specifies whether the outputted format are integers (\code{int=TRUE}) or have decimals.
